I know that I wasn't the one who farted, and I don't think that I deserve any of the blame for what happened. I hope you understand and forgive me.\nI want to express my sincere regret for what happened, but I can't help but feel like I'm the one who ruined our marriage. I know that I didn't mean to cause any harm, but I felt like I had to try and fix things"
