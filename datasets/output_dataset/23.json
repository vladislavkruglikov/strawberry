It's possible that your expectations for the service were unrealistic or that you are not getting the desired results from your interactions. You may need to find a new provider who can better meet your needs or expectations. It's also possible that the issues you are experiencing with the provider have nothing to do with their services and are caused by other factors such as communication issues, lack of responsiveness, or misconceptions about the service."
